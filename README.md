# Datathon 2025 

This is the task for the regression challenge in Datathon 2025

The task and description of dataset features can be found in [Regression description](Regression-desc.pdf).

final_work.ipynb contains the best version of the task and how it should have been analyzed etc.

datahon-day.ipynb is the notebook file created during the datathon and post-datathon.ipynb has the work and testing done just before the submition of the final report.

I am still unclear how I got the results from img below Best result from pre-processing as I cannot reproduce it anymore.
